Revision history for Perl extension Lighttpd-Control

0.03 Friday, Nov. 27, 2009
    - added the binary_path_prefixes_to_search attribute
      to make it easier to tell this module where to find
      your lighttpd install.
    - added the NetBSD specific binary path prefix to our
      list of defaults
      (thanks to Ulrich Habel)

0.02 Thursday, Nov. 6, 2008
    - changing the config file now clears the
      pid-file and server-pid slots
    - changing the pid-file slot will clear the
      server-pid slot
    - added predicate methods to check if there is
      a pid-file given and a server pid available
      - added tests for this
    - pre_startup and post_shutdown now clear the
      server pid at the right times, so that
      start/stop/start/stop will work correctly
      (Thanks to FAYLAND - RT #39819)
      - added test for this
    - post_startup will be sure to initailize the
      server pid, and blocks (printing a log-message)
      until the server has started (this can be
      overriden if needed).

    - I am getting sick of copy/pasting this stuff
      between all the projects at work, so I am packaging
      it up for release.
